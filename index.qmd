...the Atlas of Living Australia, the Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network, and the Integrated Marine Observing System, to provide data in forms that support environmental reporting, such as the State of the Environment Report. 

These 3 research infrastructures collect, manage, and organise environmental data across different categories:

The ALA is Australia’s national biodiversity database, bringing together data from natural history collections, government departments, researchers, community groups, and individuals.

TERN measures key terrestrial ecosystem attributes at hundreds of representative locations and produces ecosystem datasets at a national scale.

IMOS collects data on all aspects of the marine environment, with extensive monitoring activities in coastal and open waters.

:::{.notes}
Historically, data from these activities have certainly fed into environmental reporting. Notably, the 2016 State of the Environment report referenced particular datasets from these 3 infrastructures, but it was difficult to access the data directly, and there was no opportunity down the track for researchers to evaluate and review the conclusions that were reached using these data. 

EcoAssets addresses this by delivering standardised, comparable data from these infrastructures, in a form that can be versioned to provide ongoing indicators over time.

:::{.notes}
The first is to improve biodiversity data pipelines among the ALA, TERN, and IMOS. In the past, the process of updating and integrating datasets from TERN and IMOS into the Atlas has not always happened consistently. Improving these processes will ensure that our national views, through the Atlas, of species occurrence, distribution, and abundance are being regularly and consistently updated

And the third is to set up a workflow that supports ongoing delivery of these datasets, in such a way that they can bet versioned over time, so this isn’t just a one-off event

Today, I’ll be focussing on this second area; I’ll give an overview of how we’ve derived these aggregated biodiversity datasets from occurrence data in the ALA. 
:::



##  {#general-profile data-menu-title="ALA General Profile"}
![](images/workflow_01.png){fig-align="center"}

:::{.notes}
We started by passing occurrence records through the ALA General Data Quality Profile, which excludes records that lack sufficient information to be useful, or that may contain common data transcription errors

:::



##  {#occ-04 data-menu-title="Occurrence 04"}
![](images/workflow_05.png){fig-align="center"}

:::{.notes}
From here, we were able to extend this to include other fields of interest. For example, based on spatial coordinates, we could determine where a record sat within the protected area network, or which IMCRA or IBRA bioregion it was found in 
:::



##  {#occ-05 data-menu-title="Occurrence 05"}
![](images/workflow_06.png){fig-align="center"}

:::{.notes}
Similarly, with an accurate species identification, we could classify records based on how they matched to threatened species or invasive species lists, which are really important for conservation and biosecurity projects.

From this point, we were able to facet and aggregate these data to produce views that start to represent environmental indicators

One way of visualising this is with a heatmap, like the one on the right. Each row is an IBRA region, and each column is a period of time, these are 5 year time periods. Each cell is coloured according to the proportion of introduced or invasive species for that time and place, with darker colours representing higher proportions.

##  {#choropleth data-menu-title="Choropleth"}
![](images/choropleth_ibra_imcra_1900.png){fig-align="center"}

:::{.notes}
These data also let us interrogate how we collect evidence of an occurrence. The ALA includes information on the type of record, and for much of the 20th century, our evidence for an occurrence came from museum specimens. More recently, this has changed in favour of human observations, which includes data collected by ecologists, field monitoring programs, and increasingly citizen science projects

This image shows the proportion of records that are made up by human observations between 1900 and 1970, with IBRA regions shown in shades or yellow and orange, and IMCRA regions in shades of blue and purple. The darker shades represent higher proportions of human observations
:::



##  {#choropleth-gif data-menu-title="Choropleth GIF"}
![](images/choropleth_ibra_imcra_observations.gif){fig-align="center"}


:::{.notes}
And we can look at how this changes over time... 

This could have implications for users, in terms of deciding what sorts of data to include (or not). For instance, more charismatic species might be over-represented in citizen projects, giving the impression that there's been a population boom

In addition to some of these examples that I've gone through, we're also working with a team at ABARES to support their data requirements for the 2023 State of the Forests Report, which involves facetting the data such that we can assess levels of biodiversity within the national forest estate

All these datasets are freely available right now, and I hope seeing some of these examples has given you all ideas for potential use cases. They're available on the EcoAssets website, which can be accessed at ecoassets.org.au

Clicking on the DATA tab will navigate to a list of all the available assets, and clicking on any of these links will bring up a page with the option to download the data, and view the metadata. This includes a brief description of the dataset, and explanation of how we derived the aggregated counts, and information on how to cite these data if you do use them

[Event-based datasets]{.custom-text-light .absolute top="450px" left="15px"}


:::{.notes}
The datasets currently available on the website are based on occurrence records in the Atlas, and the next new and exciting thing we’re working on is generating event-based datasets for EcoAssets. IMOS and TERN both collect significant amounts of data at the level of site-based surveys or through species tracking activities, and ALA likewise has extensive datasets from providers like BirdLife, who carry out systematic surveys at regular intervals. We anticipate that these event-based datasets will complement the biodiversity datasets already available, and provide some measure of the extent of monitoring happening across the country.
